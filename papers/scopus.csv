Previous studies suggest that a large increase in wintertime Arctic polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) might have promoted Arctic amplification through additional greenhouse warming. High methane concentrations in warm climates might have increased stratospheric water vapor providing favorable conditions for PSCs. However, methane concentrations in past warm climates are extremely uncertain. Here, we revisit the PSC hypothesis by exploring PSC changes under very high methane levels, 43 preindustrial carbon dioxide, and strong polar-amplified surface warming, using a whole-atmosphere model with fully interactive chemistry. We find that with polar-amplified warming there is a large increase in Arctic outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) that reduces as the methane concentration is increased. PSCs increase monotonically with methane concentration. A large radiative cooling and an increase in water vapor in the stratosphere increases Arctic PSCs, which follow a power law with respect to relative humidity. Using a two-way partial radiative perturbation technique, we show that the OLR reduction due to PSCs is similar to the direct radiative forcing of methane for high methane levels. Thus, we find that PSCs could play an important role in Arctic warming in a warmer-than-present-day climate, but only if methane levels were higher than suggested by previous modeling studies for past warm climates. © 2023 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85152195995

This leaves some researchers unclear as to whether findings from Australia apply to systems elsewhere (or vice-versa), which has consequences for the development of ecological theory and the application of ecological management principles. We analyzed 594,612 observations spanning 85 variables describing global climate, soil, geochemistry, plants, animals, and ecosystem function to test if Australia is broadly different to the other continents and compare how different each continent is from the global mean. We found significant differences between Australian and global means for none of 15 climate variables, only seven of 25 geochemistry variables, three of 16 soil variables, five of 12 plant trait variables, four of 11 animal variables, and one of five ecosystem function variables. Seven of these differences remained significant when we adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing: high soil pH, high soil concentrations of sodium and strontium, a high proportion of nitrogen-fixing plants, low plant leaf nitrogen concentration, low annual production rate to birth in mammals, and low marine productivity. Our analyses reveal numerous similarities between Australia and Africa and highlight dissimilarities between continents in the northern vs. southern hemispheres. Australia ranked the most distinctive continent for 26 variables, more often than Europe (15 variables), Africa (13 variables), Asia (12 variables each), South America (11 variables) or North America (8 variables). Australia was distinctive in a range of soil conditions and plant traits, and a few bird and mammal traits, tending to sit at a more extreme end of variation for some variables related to resource availability. However, combined analyses revealed that, overall, Australia is not significantly more different to the global mean than Africa, South America, or Europe. In conclusion, while Australia does have some unique and distinctive features, this is also true for each of the other continents, and the data do not support the idea that Australia is an overall outlier in its biotic or abiotic characteristics.

As an intricate part of the global climate system, EUC dynamics are essential to understanding future climate change but are poorly represented in global coupled climate models. This study examines EUC representation and future changes in the latest generations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6 and CMIP5) and an eddy-permitting ocean model. We also examine historical and projected changes in EUC source waters, including the Mindanao Current (MC), New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU), and interior thermocline convergence. The circulation features in the models are broadly consistent with observations and ocean reanalyses, but improvements from CMIP5 to CMIP6 are limited. In the future projections, the EUC is enhanced in the western Pacific, with less prominent changes in CMIP6, but more so in the eddy-permitting model. The western Pacific EUC enhancement is likely associated with a wind-driven redirection of waters south of the equator, in which the NGCU boundary flow increases while the interior thermocline convergence decreases. This is superimposed on an overall weakening of the North Pacific subtropical overturning cell, including the MC, interior thermocline convergence, and Ekman divergence. As EUC heat and nutrient composition is linked to its sources, these projected changes have implications for the EUC's role in air–sea feedbacks, nutrient replenishment, and oxygen minimum zone ventilation in the eastern Pacific.

Attempts have been made in the past to define an index that quantifies the variability in the ZW3 pattern; however, existing methods are based on fixed geographical locations and fail to capture certain ZW3 events because of strong variability in phase. In addition, a fixed spatial index poorly characterizes ZW3 in CMIP models, which can exhibit biases in the mean phase of the ZW3 pattern. In this study, we introduce a new way to characterize ZW3 variability by incorporating two indices, one each for magnitude and phase, based on the combination of the first two empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of the 500-hPa meridional wind anomalies. We show that the new ZW3 index provides a clear advantage over past indices because it captures a substantially higher proportion of variance (∼40% compared to ∼16%), and it can be used for both reanalysis datasets and coupled climate models regardless of model biases. A composite analysis associated with the new index reveals a strong relationship between the ZW3 defined by our index and sea ice fraction around Antarctica, with significant regional sea ice anomalies during strong ZW3 events with different phases. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136995788

The need to forecast these extremes and expected future increases in their intensity and frequency motivates a need to better understand the physical processes that connect climate modes to regional precipitation. Focusing on east Australia, where precipitation is driven by multiple interacting climate modes, this study provides a new perspective into the links between large-scale modes of climate variability and precipitation. Using a Lagrangian back-trajectory approach, we examine how El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modifies the supply of evaporative moisture for precipitation, and how this is modulated by the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) and southern annular mode (SAM). We demonstrate that La Niña modifies large-scale moisture transport together with local thermodynamic changes to facilitate local precipitation generation, whereas below-average precipitation during El Niño stems predominantly from increased regional subsidence. These dynamic–thermodynamic processes were often more pronounced during co-occurring La Niña/ negative IOD and El Niño/positive IOD periods. As the SAM is less strongly correlated with ENSO, the impact of co-occurring ENSO and SAM largely depended on the state of ENSO. La Niña–related processes were exacerbated when combined with 1SAM and dampened when combined with 2SAM, and vice versa during El Niño. This new perspective on how interacting climate modes physically influence regional precipitation can help elucidate how model biases affect the simulation of Australian climate, facilitating model improvement and understanding of regional impacts from long-term changes in these modes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: How climate modes modulate the oceanic and terrestrial sources of moisture for rainfall in east Australia is investigated. East Australia is wetter during La Niña because more moisture is transported into the region and is more easily turned into rainfall when it arrives, whereas drier conditions during El Niño are because local conditions inhibit the conversion of moisture into rainfall. Distant atmospheric changes over the Indian and Southern Oceans can intensify these changes. Our results can be used to better understand and predict the regional impact of long-term changes in these modes of climate variability, which are potentially altered under climate change.

Heat gained from upwelling and watermass transformation in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (PO) is transported through the ITF into the Indian Ocean, ultimately connecting to high-latitude regions of heat loss such as the North Atlantic. However, state-of-the-art General Circulation Models (GCMs) often poorly simulate upwelling, particularly in the eastern Pacific boundary regions. Recent studies have hypothesized that these difficulties may be related to biases in downstream ITF volume and heat transport, whereby insufficient warm surface water from the western PO passes through the ITF, a complex region that is hard to accurately represent in models. Here, we test this hypothesis using a coarse-resolution ocean model by artificially widening the ITF and allowing greater quantities of warm water to exit the western PO. This reduces the Indo-Pacific sea-surface height and pressure gradient biases. Using diagnostics in temperature coordinates, we trace the source of increased ITF warm-water transport to enhanced watermass transformation of cold-to-warm waters in the eastern tropical PO. Additional cool water is brought to the surface in the Cold Tongue region, resulting in an enhancement of surface flux-driven warming. However, we find only limited evidence for changes in upwelling at lower temperatures along the eastern PO margins, considerably less than hypothesized in a previous study. Our experiment provides useful insights to help understand simulated ITF mass and heat transport biases and their links with the tropical PO in GCMs. © 2022. American Geophysical Union.

Examination of a limited number of past events suggests that certain co-occurring terrestrial and marine heatwaves have common drivers. Co-occurring events may also interact via local land-sea interactions, thereby altering the likelihood of these events. This study explores possible links between adjacent coastal marine and terrestrial heatwaves around Australia using observation and reanalysis data. We find a significant increase in the number of terrestrial heatwave days in the presence of an adjacent co-occurring marine heatwave along the coastal belt of Australia. In most regions, this increase persists at least 150 km inland. This suggests that processes operating beyond the narrow coastal belt are important in most regions. We also show that synoptic conditions driving a terrestrial heatwave in three locations around Australia are conducive for warming the ocean, which would increase the likelihood of a marine heatwave occurring. However, ocean state must also be conducive to reach MHW conditions. Our findings suggest that co-occurring terrestrial and marine heatwaves co-occur more frequently than chance would dictate, and that large scale synoptics may be conducive to both coastal terrestrial and marine heatwaves.

We show that the ensemble consistently suggests a weakening of ENSO variability, with a mean reduction of 25% (±16%). We further show that shifts in the equatorial Pacific mean state cannot fully explain these changes. Instead, ENSO was suppressed by a series of off-equatorial processes triggered by a northward displacement of the Pacific intertropical convergence zone: weakened convective feedback and intensified Southern Hemisphere circulation, which inhibit various processes that initiate ENSO. The connection between the climatological intertropical convergence zone position and ENSO we find in the past is expected to operate in our warming world with important ramifications for ENSO variability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135803603

To help resolve this question we calculate probability distributions of the committed warming that would ensue if all anthropogenic emissions were stopped immediately, or at successive future times. We use a simple Earth system model together with a Bayesian approach that incorporates multiple lines of evidence and accounts for known model biases. This analysis reveals a wide range of possible outcomes, including no further warming, but also a 15% chance of overshooting the 1.5 °C target, and 1%-2% chance for 2 °C, even if all emissions had stopped in 2020. If emissions merely stabilize in 2020 and stop in 2040, these probabilities increase to 90% and 17%. The uncertainty arises mainly from that of present forcing by aerosols. Rather than there being a fixed date by which emissions must stop, the probability of reaching either target - which is already below 100% - gradually diminishes with delays in eliminating emissions, by 3%-4% per year for 1.5 °C. © 2022 The Author(s).

They can affect regional climate and strongly influence the dispersion and distribution of marine species. Using state-of-the-art climate models from the latest and previous Climate Model Intercomparison Projects, we evaluate upper ocean circulation and examine future projections, focusing on subtropical and low-latitude WBCs. Despite their coarse resolution, climate models successfully reproduce most large-scale circulation features with ensemble mean transports typically within the range of observational uncertainty, although there is often a large spread across the models and some currents are systematically too strong or weak. Despite considerable differences in model structure, resolution and parameterisations, many currents show highly consistent projected changes across the models. For example, the East Australian Current, Brazil Current and Agulhas Current extensions are projected to intensify, while the Gulf Stream, Indonesian Throughflow and Agulhas Current are projected to weaken. Intermodel differences in most future circulation changes can be explained in part by projected changes in the large-scale surface winds. In moving to the latest model generation, despite structural model advancements, we find little systematic improvement in the simulation of ocean transports nor major differences in the projected changes. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105363848

In the Southern Hemisphere, strong warming over the WBC extensions has been observed over the last few decades, with enhanced warming projected into the future. This amplified warming has primarily been linked to poleward intensification of the mid-latitude westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere. Changes in these winds are often thought of as being zonally symmetric; however, recent studies show that they contain strong zonal asymmetries in certain ocean basins. The importance of these zonal asymmetries for the Southern Ocean has not yet been investigated. In this study, we use an ocean-sea-ice model forced by prescribed atmospheric fields to quantify the contribution of projected zonally asymmetric atmospheric changes in generating future ocean warming and circulation changes in the subtropical WBC regions. We find that the zonally asymmetric component of atmospheric forcing, characterized by a pattern that is consistent across CMIP6 models, can explain more than 30% (>2°C) of the sea surface temperature (SST) warming found in the Tasman Sea and southern Australia region and a sizable fraction of warming in the Agulhas Current region. These changes in SST in both the Indian and Pacific basins are found to be primarily driven by increases in the advection of warm tropical water to the mid-latitudes due to changes in the large-scale subtropical ocean gyres, which in turn can largely be explained by changes in the mid-latitude surface wind stress patterns. © 2021.

The fully coupled model is shown to be capable of reproducing correctly relevant features such as the seasonality, spatial distribution and intensity of ECLs while it partially resolves mesoscale processes, such as air-sea feedbacks over ocean eddies and fronts. The mesoscale thermal feedback (TFB) and the current feedback (CFB) are shown to influence the intensity of northern ECLs (north of (Formula presented.)), with the TFB modulating the pre-storm sea surface temperature (SST) by shifting ECL locations eastwards and the CFB modulating the wind stress. By fully uncoupling the atmospheric model of NOW, the intensity of northern ECLs is increased due to the absence of the cold wake that provides a negative feedback to the cyclone. The number of ECLs might also be affected by the air-sea feedbacks but large interannual variability hampers significant results with short-term simulations. The TFB and CFB modify the climatology of SST (mean and variability) but no direct link is found between these changes and those noticed in ECL properties. These results show that the representation of ECLs, mainly north of (Formula presented.), depend on how air-sea feedbacks are simulated. This is particularly important for atmospheric downscaling of climate projections as small-scale SST interactions and the effects of ocean currents are not accounted for. © 2021.

This pattern is present in both the mean atmospheric circulation and its variability on daily, seasonal and interannual timescales. While the zonal wave 3 pattern has substantial impacts on meridional heat transport and Antarctic sea ice extent, the reason for its existence remains uncertain, although it has long been assumed to be linked to the presence of three major landmasses in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Here we use an atmospheric general circulation model to show that the stationary zonal wave 3 pattern is instead driven by zonally asymmetric deep convection in the tropics, with little influence from extratropical orography or landmasses. Localized regions of deep convection in the tropics form a local Hadley cell, which in turn creates a wave source in the subtropics that excites a poleward- and eastward-propagating wave train, forming quasi-stationary waves in the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes. Our findings suggest that changes in tropical deep convection, either due to natural variability or climate change, fundamentally control the zonal wave 3 pattern, with implications for southern high-latitude climate, ocean circulation and sea ice. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113816465

The potential implications for Pacific Island economies in 2050 include an average decline in purse-seine catch of 20% (range = −10% to −30%), an average annual loss in regional tuna-fishing access fees of US$90 million (range = −US$40 million to –US$140 million) and reductions in government revenue of up to 13% (range = −8% to −17%) for individual Pacific SIDS. Redistribution of tuna under a lower-emissions scenario (RCP 4.5) is projected to reduce the purse-seine catch from the waters of Pacific SIDS by an average of only 3% (range = −12% to +9%), indicating that even greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the Paris Agreement, would provide a pathway to sustainability for tuna-dependent Pacific Island economies. An additional pathway involves Pacific SIDS negotiating within the regional fisheries management organization to maintain the present-day benefits they receive from tuna, regardless of the effects of climate change on the distribution of the fish. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111623874

Additionally, model intercomparisons show a large spread in the magnitude of Arctic warming for these warmer-than-modern climates. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these disagreements, including the unrealistic representation of polar clouds or underestimated poleward heat transport in the models. This study provides an intercomparison of Arctic cloud and atmospheric heat transport (AHT) responses to strong imposed polar-amplified surface ocean warming across four atmosphere-only GCMs. All models simulate an increase in high clouds throughout the year; the resulting reduction in longwave radiation loss to space acts to support the imposed Arctic warming. The response of low- and midlevel clouds varies considerably across the models, with models responding differently to surface warming and sea ice removal. The AHT is consistently weaker in the imposed warming experiments due to a large reduction in dry static energy transport that offsets a smaller increase in latent heat transport, thereby opposing the imposed surface warming. Our idealized polar amplification experiments require very large increases in implied ocean heat transport (OHT) to maintain steady state. Increased CO2 or tropical temperatures that likely characterized past warm climates reduce the need for such large OHT increases. 2021 American Meteorological Society",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108287025

Using a long simulation from a coupled climate model, we examine oceanic and mixed atmosphere-ocean teleconnections to the south-western Indian Ocean (SWIO) associated with Rossby waves excited by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Reconstruction of propagating ENSO-induced sea-level anomalies from the simulation using an optimized linear wave model with dissipation highlights the prominent role of baroclinic, rather than barotropic, Rossby waves in modulating sea-surface heights. Between 9.5° and 18.5°S, El Niño-associated anomalous anticyclonic wind-stress fields initiate downwelling Rossby waves, potentially influencing SWIO regional climate around 1–4 seasons after El Niño peak, while also destructively interfering with upwelling waves triggered on the eastern boundary by oceanic teleconnections. Further south, weaker ENSO winds, dissipation, non-linear processes, and interference from higher-mode Rossby waves limit ENSO influences in the SWIO. In the model, ENSO-associated predictability is therefore constrained by the “atmospheric” rather than “oceanic” bridge. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

This study applies a marine heatwave framework to analyse a global sea surface temperature product and identify the most extreme events, based on their intensity, duration and spatial extent. Many of these events have yet to be described in terms of their physical attributes, generation mechanisms, or ecological impacts. Our synthesis identifies commonalities between marine heatwave characteristics and seasonality, links to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, triggering processes and impacts on ocean productivity. The most intense events preferentially occur in summer, when climatological oceanic mixed layers are shallow and winds are weak, but at a time preceding climatological maximum sea surface temperatures. Most subtropical extreme marine heatwaves were triggered by persistent atmospheric high-pressure systems and anomalously weak wind speeds, associated with increased insolation, and reduced ocean heat losses. Furthermore, the most extreme events tended to coincide with reduced chlorophyll-a concentration at low and mid-latitudes. Understanding the importance of the oceanic background state, local and remote drivers and the ocean productivity response from past events are critical steps toward improving predictions of future marine heatwaves and their impacts. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095691069

In the Mid-Pliocene simulations, the higher rates of warming in the northern hemisphere create an interhemispheric temperature gradient that enhances the southward cross-equatorial energy flux by up to 48%. This intensified energy flux reorganizes the atmospheric circulation leading to a northward shift of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone and a weakened and poleward displaced Southern Hemisphere Subtropical Convergences Zones. These changes result in drier-than-normal Southern Hemisphere tropics and subtropics. The evaluation of the mid-Pliocene adds a constraint to possible future warmer scenarios associated with differing rates of warming between hemispheres. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089272387

The CMIP5 multimodel mean (MMM) projection suggests up to 5°C of warming under an RCP85 scenario by 2100. Previous studies employed Sverdrup balance to associate a trend in basin wide zonally integrated wind stress curl (resulting from the multidecadal poleward intensification in the westerly winds over the Southern Ocean) with enhanced transport in the EAC extension. Possible regional drivers are yet to be considered. Here we introduce the NEMO-OASIS-WRF coupled regional climate model as a framework to improve our understanding of CMIP5 projections. We analyze a hierarchy of simulations in which the regional atmosphere and ocean circulations are allowed to freely evolve subject to boundary conditions that represent present-day and CMIP5 RCP8.5 climate change anomalies. Evaluation of the historical simulation shows an EAC extension that is stronger than similar ocean-only models and observations. This bias is not explained by a linear response to differences in wind stress. The climate change simulations show that regional atmospheric CMIP5 MMM anomalies drive 73% of the projected 12 Sv increase in EAC extension transport whereas the remote ocean boundary conditions and regional radiative forcing (greenhouse gases within the domain) play a smaller role. The importance of regional changes in wind stress curl in driving the enhanced EAC extension is consistent with linear theory where the NEMO-OASIS-WRF response is closer to linear transport estimates compared to the CMIP5 MMM. © 2020.

Here we examine the importance of sub-daily air-sea interactions over the Maritime Continent region to the rectification of longer timescale variation. In order to determine the importance of these high-frequency interactions, we conducted two regional ocean–atmosphere coupled simulations over the Maritime Continent where exchanges between the oceanic and atmospheric components are performed either every hour (i.e. resolving diurnal changes) or every day. We find that coupling frequency has a significant influence on mean sea surface temperature (SST) and the mean state and diurnal cycle of rainfall over certain regions of the western Maritime Continent where air-sea interactions are strong during the Asian monsoon season, with little effect in other regions or seasons. Without sub-daily air-sea interactions, the mean SST along the southwest off Sumatra is ~ 2 °C warmer during the period from June to October as a result of a deepening of thermocline along the coast. This deepening is linked to anomalous downwelling equatorial eastward propagating Kelvin waves triggered by westerly anomalies in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. In addition, the mean rainfall in the vicinity of ocean warming increases, thereby producing an enhanced barrier layer that also provides a positive warming feedback. Although the coupling frequency has little impact on the timing of the rainfall diurnal cycle, suppression of sub-daily coupling significantly changes the diurnal rainfall amplitude causing a relative decrease (increase) in amplitude over the coast of Northwestern (Southwestern) Sumatra during the South Asian monsoon season. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084210621

This is largely attributable to oceanic pathways that transfer ENSO-associated anomalies around the Pacific and into other basins. While the impact of atmospheric teleconnections occurs over days to weeks, oceanic teleconnections permit a memory of anomalous air-sea coupling during ENSO to persist months to years. ENSO-generated ocean perturbations are transmitted to remote regions by planetary waves. Equatorial Kelvin waves generated by intraseasonal western Pacific wind bursts travel along the equator to the eastern basin and excite coastally trapped waves that extend ENSO’s reach to high latitudes along the American coastlines. Rossby waves that either radiate from the coast with the passage of these Kelvin waves or are generated in the ocean interior by ENSO-related wind anomalies propagate signals westward across the basin, rapidly altering tropical circulation and affecting subtropical gyres. At the leaky western boundary, the waves excited by ENSO radiate and scatter through the Indonesian seas to enter the Indian Ocean.

Here we assess whether climate models from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) project robust changes in ENSO’s regional temperature and precipitation teleconnections in the late 21st century, comparing the historical simulations (between 1950 and 1999) and high-emission future simulations (between 2040 and 2089). In order to quantify the importance of internal variability in these projected changes, we examine an ensemble of coupled model simulations from the Max-Planck-Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE). Except for a few regions, the changes in ENSO’s temperature and precipitation teleconnections for most regions are not significant across the majority of models. Exceptions include consistent projected changes to temperature teleconnections over equatorial South America and East Africa, which are robust during La Niña events. Despite this, by assessing all regions together, a significant amplification of the temperature teleconnections is identified for La Niña events. Additionally, we find an overall projected weakening relative to the historical precipitation teleconnection when analysis is limited to regions that correctly reproduce the observed precipitation teleconnections. It remains unclear to what extent a change in regional ENSO teleconnections will be apparent, as it is clear that the changes in ENSO’s teleconnections are relatively small compared to the regional variability during the historical period. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074606389

Projected future climate impacts have also been described, mainly focused on a reduced impact of the mid-latitude jet as the ozone hole gradually repairs. However, there is little appreciation of the surface warming that has been avoided as a result of the Montreal Protocol, despite CFCs being potent greenhouse gases. Instead, the issue of ozone depletion and climate change are often thought of as two distinct problems, even though both ozone and CFCs impact Earth's radiation budget. Here we show that a substantial amount of warming has been avoided because of the Montreal Protocol, even after factoring in the surface cooling associated with stratospheric ozone depletion. As of today, as much as 1.1 °C warming has been avoided over parts of the Arctic. Future climate benefits are even stronger, with 3 °C-4 °C Arctic warming and ∼1 °C global average warming avoided by 2050; corresponding to a ∼25% mitigation of global warming.

Several prominent MHWs have attracted scientific and public interest, and recent assessments have documented global and regional increases in their frequency. However, for proactive marine management, it is critical to understand how patterns might change in the future. Here, we estimate future changes in MHWs to the end of the 21st century, as simulated by the CMIP5 global climate model projections. Significant increases in MHW intensity and count of annual MHW days are projected to accelerate, with many parts of the ocean reaching a near-permanent MHW state by the late 21st century. The two greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios considered (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5) strongly affect the projected intensity of MHW events, the proportion of the globe exposed to permanent MHW states, and the occurrence of the most extreme MHW events. Comparison with simulations of a natural world, without anthropogenic forcing, indicate that these trends have emerged from the expected range of natural variability within the first half of the 21st century. This discrepancy implies a degree of “anthropogenic emergence,” with a departure from the natural MHW conditions that have previously shaped marine ecosystems for centuries or even millennia.

The reduced onshore flow is related to changes in the alongshore pressure gradient. While the alongshore pressure gradient change is consistent with the Indonesian Throughflow projected weakening, we found no inter-model relationship between these changes. In the south-western Indian Ocean, the models project a robust weakening of the North East and South East Madagascar Currents, Agulhas Current and transport through the Mozambique Channel.

This paper presents the first estimate of dFAD beaching events in the WCPO (>1300 in 2016–2017) and their distribution. Lagrangian simulations of virtual dFADs, released subject to contrasting deployment distributions, help us determine the relative importance of operational versus environmental drivers of dFADs drifting to beaching areas. The highest levels of beaching, occurring on Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, are likely a result of the prevailing westward oceanic circulation and subsequent local processes driving dFADs towards land. Similarly, high beaching rates in Tuvalu appear to be due to the general circulation of the WCPO. In contrast, beaching in Kiribati Gilbert Islands appear to be more strongly related to dFAD deployment strategy. These findings indicate that reducing beaching events via changes in deployment locations may be difficult. As such, management approaches combining dFAD deployment limits, the use of biodegradable dFADs, recoveries at-sea close to sensitive areas and/or beached dFAD removal should be considered. © 2019, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072782270

Clear patterns emerge, including coherent relationships between enhanced or suppressed MHW occurrences with the dominant climate modes across most regions of the globe – an important exception being western boundary current regions where reports of MHW events are few and ocean-climate relationships are complex. These results provide a global baseline for future MHW process and prediction studies. © 2019, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067358586

However, despite increasing greenhouse forcing, there was an unprecedented intensification of the Pacific Trade Winds during 1992–2011, that co-occurred with a temporary slowdown in global surface warming. Using ensemble simulations from three different climate models starting from different initial conditions, we find a large spread in projected 20-year globally averaged surface air temperature trends that can be linked to differences in Pacific climate variability. This implies diminished predictive skill for global surface air temperature trends over decadal timescales, to a large extent due to intrinsic Pacific Ocean variability. We show, however, that this uncertainty can be considerably reduced when the initial oceanic state is known and well represented in the model. In this case, the spatial patterns of 20-year surface air temperature trends depend largely on the initial state of the Pacific Ocean. © 2019, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065096852

However, climate models struggle to realistically simulate rainfall and the skill of rainfall prediction in decadal experiments is poor. Here, we examine how predictions of sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) indices from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 decadal experiments can provide skillful rainfall forecasts at interannual timescales for Australia. Forecasts of commonly used SSTA indices relevant to Australian seasonal rainfall are derived from decadal hindcasts of six different climate models and corrected for model drift. The corrected indices are then combined to form a multimodel ensemble. The resultant forecasts are used as predictors in a statistical rainfall model developed in this study. As SSTA forecasts lose skill with increasing lead time, a new methodology for predicting interannual rainfall is proposed. We allow our statistical prediction model to evolve with lead time while accounting for the loss of skill in SSTA forecasts instead of using one statistical model for all lead times. Results in this pilot study across two of the largest climate zones in Australia show that SSTA outputs from the decadal experiments provide enhanced skill in rainfall prediction over using the conventional model (based purely on lagged observed indices) up to a maximum of three years ahead. This methodology could be used more broadly for other regions around the world where rainfall variability is known to have strong links to ocean temperatures. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

At the same time an unprecedented marine heatwave developed in the western South Atlantic. The drought was linked to suppression of the South Atlantic convergence zone and its associated rainfall, which led to water shortages in Brazil and impacted food supplies globally. Here we show from observations that such droughts and adjacent marine heatwaves have a common remote cause. Atmospheric blocking triggered by tropical convection in the Indian and Pacific oceans can cause persistent anticyclonic circulation that not only leads to severe drought but also generates marine heatwaves in the adjacent ocean. We show that increased shortwave radiation due to reduced cloud cover and reduced ocean heat loss from weaker winds are the main contributors to the establishment of marine heatwaves in the region. The proposed mechanism, which involves droughts, extreme air temperature over land and atmospheric blocking explains approximately 60% of the marine heatwave events in the western South Atlantic. We also identified an increase in frequency, duration, intensity and extension of marine heatwave events over the satellite period 1982–2016. Moreover, surface primary production was reduced during these events with implications for regional fisheries. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068937301

The initial findings of the TPOS 2020 Project embrace new strategic approaches and technologies in a user-driven design and the variable focus of the Framework for Ocean Observing. User requirements arise from climate prediction and research, climate change and the climate record, and coupled modeling and data assimilation more generally. Requirements include focus on the upper ocean and air-sea interactions, sampling of diurnal variations, finer spatial scales and emerging demands related to biogeochemistry and ecosystems. One aim is to sample a diversity of climatic regimes in addition to the equatorial zone. The status and outlook for meeting the requirements of the design are discussed. This is accomplished through integrated and complementary capabilities of networks, including satellites, moorings, profiling floats and autonomous vehicles. Emerging technologies and methods are also discussed. The outlook highlights a few new foci of the design: biogeochemistry and ecosystems, low-latitude western boundary currents and the eastern Pacific. Low latitude western boundary currents are conduits of tropical-subtropical interactions, supplying waters of mid to high latitude origin to the western equatorial Pacific and into the Indonesian Throughflow. They are an essential part of the recharge/discharge of equatorial warm water volume at interannual timescales and play crucial roles in climate variability on regional and global scales. The tropical eastern Pacific, where extreme El Niño events develop, requires tailored approaches owing to the complex of processes at work there involving coastal upwelling, and equatorial cold tongue dynamics, the oxygen minimum zone and the seasonal double Intertropical Convergence Zone. A pilot program building on existing networks is envisaged, complemented by a process study of the East Pacific ITCZ/warm pool/cold tongue/stratus coupled system. The sustainability of TPOS depends on effective and strong collaborative partnerships and governance arrangements. Revisiting regional mechanisms and engaging new partners in the context of a planned and systematic design will ensure a multi-purpose, multi-faceted integrated approach that is sustainable and responsive to changing needs. © 2019 Smith, Kessler, Cravatte, Sprintall, Wijffels, Cronin, Sutton, Serra, Dewitte, Strutton, Hill, Sen Gupta, Lin, Takahashi, Chen and Brunner.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061740690

A greater understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of these objects as they drift with ocean currents is critical for understanding historical changes in fishing power, spatial management, and examining the effect of ambient dFAD density on catch and effort. Here, dFAD dynamics were estimated for all floating object sets made by purse seiners in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean during 2016 and 2017. The drift trajectories of these floating objects prior to the observed fishing events were estimated by seeding virtual Lagrangian particles within a state-of-the-art hydrodynamics model, and simulating their movements backwards in time. Resulting trajectory distributions are similar to observed dFAD trajectories from the same period. The approach provides spatial density estimates in areas where observed dFAD data are incomplete, particularly in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Howland and Baker Islands, and certain high seas areas. We provide estimates of inter-EEZ connectivity of dFADs, which highlight the fact that dFADs set upon in small EEZs such as Nauru and Howland and Baker Islands are likely to have drifted from neighbouring EEZs less than one month prior to fishing. dFADs typically transited multiple EEZs, with a median of 4 and a maximum of 14, when assuming a drift-time of six months. Moreover, between 4 and 22% of dFAD sets made in the WCPO were estimated to have originated from the Eastern Pacific Ocean, depending on drift-time. We examine our results in the context of the improved management and assessment of dFAD fisheries, providing a methodology to estimated relative dFAD density over historical periods to support analyses of catch and effort. The sensitivity of these estimates to hydrodynamic models, including the proposed SKIM doppler radar altimetry method, is discussed. © 2019 The Author(s).

Recent studies have identified Pacific decadal variability as a major driver of periods of rapid and slower global mean surface air temperature change. Here, we use an eddy-permitting global ocean model to investigate the role of the observed 1992–2011 trade wind intensification and concurrent trends in surface atmospheric variables over the Pacific associated with the negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) in driving ocean circulation and heat content changes. We find a strengthening of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) in response to strengthened winds, which brings cooler water to the surface of the eastern Pacific and an increase in the Pacific shallow overturning cells (PSOC), which in turn drives additional heat into the subsurface western Pacific. The wind acceleration also results in an increase in the strength and subsequent heat transport of the Indonesian throughflow (ITF), which transports some of the additional heat from the western Pacific into the Indian Ocean. The circulation changes result in warming of the subsurface western Pacific, cooling of the upper eastern Pacific Ocean and warming of the subsurface Indian Ocean, with an overall increase in Indo-Pacific heat content. Further experiments impose a symmetric reversal of the atmospheric state to examine how the ocean would behave if the winds (and other atmospheric variables) were to revert to their initial state. This mimics a return to the neutral phase of the IPO, characterised by a weakening of the Pacific trade winds. In response we find a slowdown of the EUC and the PSOC, which results in a return to climatological SST conditions in the western and eastern Pacific. The ITF also slows towards its original strength. However, the subsurface temperature, heat content and ITF responses are not symmetric due to an overall increase in the surface heat flux into the ocean associated with the cooler surface of the Pacific. There may also be irreversible heat transport across the thermocline via diapycnal mixing, further contributing to this asymmetry. The net result of the experiment is that the Indo-Pacific subsurface ocean is warmer than it was in its initial state. © 2017, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031911075

Discrete, climatically extreme events such as cyclones, floods, and heatwaves can also significantly affect regional environments and species, including humans. Climate change is expected to intensify these events and thus exacerbate their effects. Climatic extremes also occur in the ocean, and recent decades have seen many high-impact marine heatwaves (MHWs)—anomalously warm water events that may last many months and extend over thousands of square kilometers. A range of biological, economic, and political impacts have been associated with the more intense MHWs, and measuring the severity of these phenomena is becoming more important. Progress in understanding and public awareness will be facilitated by consistent description of these events. Here, we propose a detailed categorization scheme for MHWs that builds on a recently published classification, combining elements from schemes that describe atmospheric heatwaves and hurricanes. Category I, II, III, and IV MHWs are defined based on the degree to which temperatures exceed the local climatology and illustrated for 10 MHWs. While there is a long-term increase in the occurrence frequency of all MHW categories, the largest trend is a 24% increase in the area of the ocean where strong (Category II) MHWs occur. Use of this scheme can help explain why biological impacts associated with different MHWs can vary widely and provides a consistent way to compare events. We also propose a simple naming convention based on geography and year that would further enhance scientific and public awareness of these marine events. © 2018 by The Oceanography Society.

Conversely, Lagrangian, or individual-based, models simulate the movement of individual particles moving in continuous space, with broader-scale patterns such as distribution being an emergent property of many, potentially adaptive, individuals. These models offer advantages in examining dynamics across spatiotemporal scales and making comparisons with observations from individual-scale data. Here, we introduce and describe such a model, the Individual-based Kinesis, Advection and Movement of Ocean ANimAls model (Ikamoana), which we use to replicate the movement processes of an existing Eulerian model for marine predators (the Spatial Ecosystem and Population Dynamics Model, SEAPODYM). Ikamoana simulates the movement of either individual or groups of animals by physical ocean currents, habitat-dependent stochastic movements (kinesis), and taxis movements representing active searching behaviours. Applying our model to Pacific skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), we show that it accurately replicates the evolution of density distribution simulated by SEAPODYM with low time-mean error and a spatial correlation of density that exceeds 0.96 at all times. We demonstrate how the Lagrangian approach permits easy tracking of individuals’ trajectories for examining connectivity between different regions, and show how the model can provide independent estimates of transfer rates between commonly used assessment regions. In particular, we find that retention rates in most assessment regions are considerably smaller (up to a factor of 2) than those estimated by this population of skipjack's primary assessment model. Moreover, these rates are sensitive to ocean state (e.g. El Nino vs La Nina) and so assuming fixed transfer rates between regions may lead to spurious stock estimates. A novel feature of the Lagrangian approach is that individual schools can be tracked through time, and we demonstrate that movement between two assessment regions at broad temporal scales includes extended transits through other regions at finer-scales. Finally, we discuss the utility of this modeling framework for the management of marine reserves, designing effective monitoring programmes, and exploring hypotheses regarding the behaviour of hard-to-observe oceanic animals. © 2018 The Authors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046347875

Future bleaching is unlikely to be spatially uniform. Therefore, understanding what determines regional differences will be critical for adaptation management. Here, using a cumulative heat stress metric, we show that characteristics of regional SST determine the future bleaching risk patterns. Incorporating observed information on SST variability, in assessing future bleaching risk, provides novel options for management strategies. As a consequence, the known biases in climate model variability and the uncertainties in regional warming rate across climate models are less detrimental than previously thought. We also show that the thresholds used to indicate reef viability can strongly influence a decision on what constitutes a potential refugia. Observing and understanding the drivers of regional variability, and the viability limits of coral reefs, is therefore critical for making meaningful projections of coral bleaching risk.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032709156

The MMM further shows that the expansion of ENSO teleconnection extent is at least partly related to a strengthening of ENSO teleconnections over continental regions; however, a consistent strengthening is not found across the individual models. This suggests that while more land may be affected by ENSO, the existing teleconnections may not be simply strengthened. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

However, most drift correction studies consider a relatively small sample of variables and models. Here, we present a systematic application of the existing drift correction strategies for decadal predictions of various sea surface temperature-based metrics from a suite of five state-of-the-art climate models (CanCM4i1, GFDL-CM2.1, HadCM3i2&i3, MIROC5, and MPI-ESM-LR). The best method of drift correction for each metric and model is reported. Preliminary analysis suggests that there is no single method of drift correction that consistently performs best. Initial condition-based drift correction provides the lowest errors in most regions for MIROC5 and the two HadCM3 models, whereas the trend-based drift correction produces lowest errors for CanCM4i1, GFDL-CM2.1, and MPI-ESM-LR over the largest share of the area. There is no merit in using a k-nearest neighbor approach for these drift correction methods. Further, in almost all cases, the multimodel ensemble outperforms the individual models, and thus, the study conclusively suggests using forecasts based on multimodel averages. We also show some additional benefit to be gained by drift correcting each model/metric using their best correction method prior to model averaging and suggest that the results presented here would help potential users expend time and resources judiciously while dealing with outputs from these experiments. ©2017.

Here we examine the relationship between the TBV and regional rainfall, which, if significant, would imply that the TBV predictability could be used to improve rainfall forecasts. We find TBV to be significantly related to rainfall, a relationship that is strongest over Australia during spring. We find Australia to experience drier conditions during the positive phase of TBV and wetter conditions during the negative phase, a pattern similar to that of ENSO. Furthermore, TBV is associated with rainfall responses that are of similar magnitude to ENSO, but there is some degree of independence between TBV and the Pacific modes defined by sea surface temperature indices. The global teleconnections related to the different TBV phases suggest that though many TBV and ENSO events overlap, pure ENSO events are primarily driven by the Pacific whereas pure TBV events are driven by the Atlantic Ocean. An El Niño coupled with a positive TBV event leads to significant drying over the east coast of Australia while the combined negative phase leads to widespread wetting over most of the country, which can be attributed to an enhancement of the anomalous Walker Circulation and the resulting moisture convergence and wind patterns. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992025547

This study investigates the sensitivity of rainfall characteristics to resolution in a coupled regional climate model configuration, in particular focusing on processes that modulate the diurnal cycle. Model biases are resolution dependent. Increasing resolution from 3/4° to 1/4° improves the mean state sea surface temperature and precipitation biases. However, at higher resolutions (1/12°) rainfall becomes too strong in most areas. Daily maximum rainfall is simulated about 2–4 h earlier than in observations over both the land and the ocean, with only small improvements over high topography at higher resolution. We develop a technique to examine cross-coastal processes associated with the rainfall diurnal cycle along all coastlines. This is used to investigate the sensitivity of the diurnal cycle to resolution and to the direction of the prevailing wind. During offshore prevailing winds, most land rainfall is confined near the coastline and associated with a shallow land-sea breeze circulation at all resolution (though rainfall partly develops directly inland at 1/12°). During onshore prevailing winds, rainfall propagates from the coastline to the island interior at 1/4° and 1/12°, whereas it appears directly over the island interior at 3/4°, and this is associated with a deep convective cell across the coastline for all resolutions. Oceanic rainfall propagates far offshore during offshore prevailing winds at all resolutions, whereas it tends to remain confined near the coastline under onshore prevailing winds condition, particularly at higher resolution. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982284271

Past analysis has revealed that despite the assimilation of observational data, there remain large differences among reanalysis products. Thus, here we examine if satellite-based synthesis products may provide more consistent estimate than reanalysis. Reanalysis product winds are, however, typically used as a background constraint in constructing the synthesis products to fill spatiotemporal gaps and to deal with satellite wind direction ambiguity. Our study identified two important factors that influence both the mean and trends from synthesized wind products. First, the choice of background wind product in synthesized satellite wind products affects the mean and long-term trends, which has implications for simulations of ocean circulation, sea level, and presumably SST. Second, we identify a clear need for developing a better understanding of, and correcting differences between in situ observations of absolute winds with the satellite-derived relative winds prior to synthesizing. This correction requires careful analysis of satellite surface winds with existing colocated in situ measurements of surface winds and currents, and will benefit from near-surface current observations of the proposed Tropical Pacific Observing System. These results also illustrate the difficulty in independently evaluating the synthesis wind products because the in situ data have been utilized at numerous steps during their development. Addressing these identified issues effectively, will require enhanced collaborations among the wind observation (both satellite and in situ), reanalysis, and synthesis communities. © 2016.

In addition, due to the spread in transit times, interannual NGCU iron pulses are scavenged, diluted, or eroded, before reaching the eastern equatorial Pacific. With an additional iron source from the nearby New Ireland Coastal Undercurrent, EUC iron concentrations become consistent with observations. Furthermore, as both the New Guinea and New Ireland Coastal Undercurrents strengthen during El Niño, increased iron input into the EUC can enhance the iron supply into the eastern equatorial Pacific.

Instead, the decrease is related to a weakening in the northward flow of deep waters entering the Pacific basin at ~40°S and an associated reduction in the net basin-wide upwelling to the north of the southern tip of Australia. This can be traced back to consistent changes in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Southern Ocean overturning, although questions still remain as to the ultimate drivers. In contrast to the ITF decrease, substantial projected changes to the upper ocean circulation of the Pacific basin are well explained by robust changes in the surface winds. ©2016.

A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience.

Yet the extent to which Australian wet and dry spells can be driven by internal atmospheric variability remains unclear. Natural variability experiments are examined to determine whether prolonged extreme wet and dry periods can arise from internal atmospheric and land variability alone. Results reveal that this is indeed the case; however, these dry and wet events are found to be less severe than in simulations incorporating coupled oceanic variability. Overall, ocean feedback processes increase the magnitude of Australian rainfall variability by about 30% and give rise to more spatially coherent rainfall impacts. Over mainland Australia, ocean interactions lead to more frequent extreme events, particularly during the rainy season. Over Tasmania, in contrast, ocean-atmosphere coupling increases mean rainfall throughout the year. While ocean variability makes Australian rainfall anomalies more severe, droughts and wet spells of duration longer than three years are equally likely to occur in both atmospheric- and ocean-driven simulations. Moreover, they are essentially indistinguishable from what one expects from a Gaussian white noise distribution. Internal atmosphere-landdriven megadroughts and megapluvials that last as long as ocean-driven events are also identified in the simulations. This suggests that oceanic variability may be less important than previously assumed for the longterm persistence of Australian rainfall anomalies.

This study quantifies differences in the two drift estimates in sea surface temperature (SST) and SST anomaly (SSTA) predictions, between experiments initialized every 5 years and those initialized every year. The effect of the recommended mean drift correction, on the two sets of predictions, is also analyzed. Our results indicate that differences between the SST drift estimates are largest over the tropical Pacific. Moreover, this difference is large for Niño 3.4 and almost negligible for the global average SSTA. Drift correction as per the mean drift from the 5 year case leads to spurious peaks in the drift-corrected Niño 3.4 (and the tropical Pacific) and sporadic improvements in skill. This problem with Niño 3.4 stems from an aliasing that occurs during the drift calculation that results from a combination of the timing of major El Niño events in relation to the initialization dates. The study recommends accounting for such sampling effects while considering any subset of the full data set. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

This paper compares observational datasets with twenty-one 155-yr historical simulations from phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5) to assess IOD and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) properties along with their synchronous and delayed relationships. In the observations and most CMIP5models, it is shown that El Niños tend to be followed by La Niñas but not the opposite, that pIODs co-occur more frequently with El Niños than nIODs with La Niñas, that nIODs tend to be followed by El Niños one year later less frequently than pIODs by La Niñas, and that including an IOD index in a linear prediction based on the Pacific warm water volume improves ENSO peak hindcasts at 14 months lead.TheIOD-ENSOdelayed relationship partly results froma combination ofENSOintrinsic properties (e.g., the tendency forElNiños to be followed by LaNiñas) and from the synchronous IOD-ENSOrelationship. The results, however, reveal that this is not sufficient to explain the high prevalence of pIOD-Niña transitions in the observations and 75%of theCMIP5models, and of nIOD-Niño transitions in 60% of CMIP5 models. This suggests that the tendency of IOD to lead ENSO by one year should be explained by a physical mechanism that, however, remains elusive in theCMIP5 models. The ability of many CMIP5models to reproduce the delayed influence of the IOD on ENSO is nonetheless a strong incentive to explore extended-range dynamical forecasts of ENSO. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957818429

It is responsible for supplying nutrients to the productive eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean. Of particular importance is the transport of iron by the EUC; the limiting nutrient in that region. Although the mean circulation and sources of EUC water are reasonably well understood, it is unclear how the contribution of water from these sources to the EUC vary on seasonal to interannual timescales. Here a Lagrangian analysis is applied to the eddy-resolving OFAM3 ocean simulation in order to identity variability in the makeup of the EUC over an 18 year period (1993-2010). While ENSO has an influence on the variability of source transport contributions to the EUC, the signal of increased (decreased) transport of water from the LLWBCs during El Niño (La Niña) periods does not translate to substantial changes in the makeup of the EUC between 165°E and 140°W. It is hypothesized that this is due to the large spread in travel times of water parcels as they travel from the source regions into the EUC. The consequent erosion of transport anomalies generated at the different western boundary source regions associated with ENSO may help explain why previous studies found little relationship between variability in iron fluxes off Papua New Guinea shelves and the chlorophyll response in the eastern tropical Pacific.

Interpreting the outputs from such complex models requires an appreciation of the many different types of modelling frameworks being used and their associated limitations and uncertainties. Both users and developers of particular model components will often have little involvement or understanding of other components within such modelling frameworks. Failure to recognise limitations and uncertainties associated with components and how these uncertainties might propagate throughout modelling frameworks can potentially result in poor advice for resource management. Unfortunately, many of the current integrative frameworks do not propagate the uncertainties of their constituent parts. In this review, we outline the major components of a generic whole of ecosystem modelling framework incorporating the external pressures of climate and fishing. We discuss the limitations and uncertainties associated with each component of such a modelling system, along with key research gaps. Major uncertainties in modelling frameworks are broadly categorised into those associated with (i) deficient knowledge in the interactions of climate and ocean dynamics with marine organisms and ecosystems; (ii) lack of observations to assess and advance modelling efforts and (iii) an inability to predict with confidence natural ecosystem variability and longer term changes as a result of external drivers (e.g. greenhouse gases, fishing effort) and the consequences for marine ecosystems. As a result of these uncertainties and intrinsic differences in the structure and parameterisation of models, users are faced with considerable challenges associated with making appropriate choices on which models to use. We suggest research directions required to address these uncertainties, and caution against overconfident predictions. Understanding the full impact of uncertainty makes it clear that full comprehension and robust certainty about the systems themselves are not feasible. A key research direction is the development of management systems that are robust to this unavoidable uncertainty. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924328974

Interpreting the projected changes in the tropical Pacific is complicated by the systematic cold tongue bias and overly westward location of the Warm Pool edge at the equator in coupled models. Here an index based on the maximum zonal salinity gradient is used to differentiate the Warm Pool from the cold tongue in each of 19 CMIP5 models. Warming is then calculated relative to the dynamic edge of the Warm Pool between the second halves of the 20th and 21st Centuries from the RCP8.5 scenario to provide a bias adjusted SST projection.Based on this definition of the edge, while the Warm Pool edge is projected to warm, it is likely to remain within 10° of its present longitude. This is in stark contrast to the large projected eastward displacements of the isotherms that are usually used to define the edge. Adjusting for the edge, warming within the Warm Pool is projected to be fairly uniform with surface water freshening. Projected warming is enhanced over the cold tongue with the net effect of reducing the zonal SST gradient. In contrast, if the warming is calculated without correcting for the edge of the Warm Pool, the warming signature is dominated by the poorer performing models with an overly westward Warm Pool, resulting in enhanced warming across the equatorial Pacific. Bias adjusting realigns the warming signature and reduces the model spread of projected warming. The biased warming signature also introduces spurious meridional and zonal SST gradients. This will potentially alter the behaviour of the atmospheric convergence zones and the dynamics of ENSO which is influenced by the extent of the Warm Pool and zonal SST gradients. © 2014.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924303183

Consistent with the view that marine species are thermally constrained, there is growing evidence that many marine species have already undergone poleward range shifts in line with warming trends. This study uses historical observations of ocean temperature and climate model projections to examine the movement of isotherms that mark the boundaries for species' thermal habitats. In particular, we compare the rates of isotherm movement between different ocean regions and at different time scales and examine to what extent the implied movement is uniform or sporadic. Widespread long-term warming implies poleward shifts of isotherms in almost all regions. However, as the speed of isotherm movement is inversely related to local meridional SST gradients and the pattern of ocean warming is heterogeneous, speeds vary considerably between regions, season and over time. At present on decadal and longer timescales, changes due to low frequency natural SST variability can dominate over human-induced changes. As such, there are multidecadal periods in certain regions when we would expect to see range shifts that are much faster or in the opposite direction to that implied by a monotonic warming. Based on central estimates from the latest suite of climate model projections, median isotherm speeds will be about seven times faster in the 21st century compared to the 20th century under business as usual emissions. Moreover, SST warming is projected to be greater in summer than in winter in most oceanic regions, contrary to what is projected to occur over land. As such net poleward isotherm speeds, particularly in the northern hemisphere summer, are projected to be considerably faster than in winter. Finally we show that isotherms can exhibit erratic migration rates over time, even under uniform warming. Isotherm movement tends to stall at thermal fronts for extended periods of time and then rapidly shift to a new position, marked by more poleward fronts. This implies that species ranges would also be expected to undergo sudden rapid shifts rather than exhibiting a gradual monotonic poleward march. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924296458

The CMIP5 models show some improvements upon CMIP3 in the simulation of the climate in the western tropical Pacific in the late 20th century. There are fewer CMIP5 models with very poor skill scores than in CMIP3 for some measures and a small group of the well-performing models in CMIP5 have lower biases than in an equivalent group from CMIP3. These best-performing models could be particularly informative for studying certain climate sensitivities and feedbacks in the region. There is evidence to reject one model as unsuitable for making regional climate projections in the region, and another two models unsuitable for analysis of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). However, while there have been improvements, many of the systematic model biases in the mean climate in CMIP3 are also present in the CMIP5 models. They are primarily related to the shape of the transition between the Indo-Pacific warm pool and equatorial cold tongue, and the associated biases in the position and orientation of the SPCZ and Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, as well as in the spatial pattern, variability and teleconnections of the West Pacific monsoon, and the simulation of El Niño Southern Oscillation. Overall, the results show that careful interpretation and consideration of biases is required when using CMIP5 outputs for generating regional climate projections for the western tropical Pacific, particularly at the country scale, just as there was with CMIP3. © 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908555353

In marine systems, changes in herbivory and the consequent loss of dominant habitat forming species can result in dramatic community phase shifts, such as from coral to macroalgal dominance when tropical fish herbivory decreases, and from algal forests to 'barrens' when temperate urchin grazing increases. Here, we propose a novel phase-shift away from macroalgal dominance caused by tropical herbivores extending their range into temperate regions. We argue that this phase shift is facilitated by poleward-flowing boundary currents that are creating ocean warming hotspots around the globe, enabling the range expansion of tropical species and increasing their grazing rates in temperate areas. Overgrazing of temperate macroalgae by tropical herbivorous fishes has already occurred in Japan and the Mediterranean. Emerging evidence suggests similar phenomena are occurring in other temperate regions, with increasing occurrence of tropical fishes on temperate reefs. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The spatial pattern of projected sea surface temperature change has a key influence on rainfall changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Here it is shown that simple indices of the size of the equatorial peak in the spatial pattern of warming and to a lesser extent the hemispheric asymmetry in warming are useful for classifying the surface temperature change in different models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Models with a more pronounced equatorial warming show a fairly distinct rainfall response compared to those with more uniform warming, including a greater ""warmer-get-wetter"" or dynamical response, whereby rainfall increases follow the surface warming anomaly. Models with a more uniform warming pattern project a smaller rainfall increase at the equator and a rainfall increase in the southern tropical Pacific, a pattern that is distinct from the multimodel mean of CMIP5. Thus, the magnitude of enhanced equatorial warming and to some extent the hemispheric asymmetry in warming provides a useful framework for constraining rainfall projections. While there is not a simple emergent constraint for enhanced equatorial warming in models in terms of past trends or bias in the current climate, further understanding of the various feedbacks involved in these features could lead to a useful constraint of rainfall for the Pacific region. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919725777

The relative importance of these two pathways is examined using virtual Lagrangian particles in a high-resolution nested ocean model. The unprecedented combination of a long integration time within an eddy-permitting ocean model simulation allows the first assessment of the interannual variability of these pathways in a realistic setting. The mean Indonesian Throughflow, as diagnosed by the particles, is 14.3 Sv, considerably higher than the diagnosed average Tasman leakage of 4.2 Sv. The time series of Indonesian Throughflow agrees well with the Eulerian transport through the major Indonesian Passages, validating the Lagrangian approach using transport-tagged particles. While the Indonesian Throughflow is mainly associated with upper ocean pathways, the Tasman leakage is concentrated in the 400-900 m depth range at subtropical latitudes. Over the effective period considered (1968-1994), no apparent relationship is found between the Tasman leakage and Indonesian Throughflow. However, the Indonesian Throughflow transport correlates with ENSO. During strong La Niñas, more water of Southern Hemisphere origin flows through Makassar, Moluccas, Ombai, and Timor Straits, but less through Moluccas Strait.

Most models realistically simulate the observed intensity and location of maximum sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies during ENSO events. However, there exist systematic biases in the westward extent of ENSOrelated SST anomalies, driven by unrealistic westward displacement and enhancement of the equatorial wind stress in the western Pacific. Almost all CMIP5 models capture the observed asymmetry in magnitude between the warm and cold events (i.e., El Niños are stronger than La Niñas) and between the two types of El Niños: that is, cold tongue (CT) El Niños are stronger than warm pool (WP) El Niños. However, most models fail to reproduce the asymmetry between the two types of La Niñas, with CT stronger thanWPevents, which is opposite to observations. Most models capture the observed peak in ENSO amplitude around December; however, the seasonal evolution of ENSO has a large range of behavior across the models. The CMIP5 models generally reproduce the duration of CT El Niños but have biases in the evolution of the other types of events. The evolution of WP El Niños suggests that the decay of this event occurs through heat content discharge in the models rather than the advection of SST via anomalous zonal currents, as seems to occur in observations.

A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this slowdown in surface warming. A key component of the global hiatus that has been identified is cool eastern Pacific sea surface temperature, but it is unclear how the ocean has remained relatively cool there in spite of ongoing increases in radiative forcing. Here we show that a pronounced strengthening in Pacific trade winds over the past two decades - unprecedented in observations/reanalysis data and not captured by climate models - is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical Pacific and a substantial slowdown in surface warming through increased subsurface ocean heat uptake. The extra uptake has come about through increased subduction in the Pacific shallow overturning cells, enhancing heat convergence in the equatorial thermocline. At the same time, the accelerated trade winds have increased equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific, lowering sea surface temperature there, which drives further cooling in other regions. The net effect of these anomalous winds is a cooling in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1-0.2C, which can account for much of the hiatus in surface warming observed since 2001. This hiatus could persist for much of the present decade if the trade wind trends continue, however rapid warming is expected to resume once the anomalous wind trends abate. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895429353

Lagrangian trajectories are obtained by advecting particles within velocity fields derived from hydrodynamic ocean models. For studies of ocean flows on scales ranging from mesoscale up to basin scales, the temporal resolution of the velocity fields should ideally not be more than a few days to capture the high frequency variability that is inherent in mesoscale features. However, in reality, the model output is often archived at much lower temporal resolutions. Here, we quantify the differences in the Lagrangian particle trajectories embedded in velocity fields of varying temporal resolution. Particles are advected from 3-day to 30-day averaged fields in a high-resolution global ocean circulation model. We also investigate whether adding lateral diffusion to the particle movement can compensate for the reduced temporal resolution.Trajectory errors reveal the expected degradation of accuracy in the trajectory positions when decreasing the temporal resolution of the velocity field. Divergence timescales associated with averaging velocity fields up to 30. days are faster than the intrinsic dispersion of the velocity fields but slower than the dispersion caused by the interannual variability of the velocity fields. In experiments focusing on the connectivity along major currents, including western boundary currents, the volume transport carried between two strategically placed sections tends to increase with increased temporal averaging. Simultaneously, the average travel times tend to decrease. Based on these two bulk measured diagnostics, Lagrangian experiments that use temporal averaging of up to nine days show no significant degradation in the flow characteristics for a set of six currents investigated in more detail. The addition of random-walk-style diffusion does not mitigate the errors introduced by temporal averaging for large-scale open ocean Lagrangian simulations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894495441

In light of such constraints, a qualitative climate projection approach is presented whereby projections are based on expected changes to the broad-scale climate features, drawing on a review of current literature and new research. Nauru sits in the region subject to seasonal and interannual migrations of the SPCZ. Climate models simulate an overly zonal SPCZ with Nauru lying too close to the dry cold tongue zone. This sets an erroneous base state for Nauru by locating it in a very different climate zone. The climate model changes in the SPCZ can be used to argue how the climate of Nauru would change were it and the SPCZ correctly collocated.

While the multi model mean monsoon rainfall from 59 models taking part in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5) fall within the observational uncertainty, considerable model spread exists. Rainfall seasonality is consistent across observations and reanalyses, but most CMIP models produce either a too peaked or a too flat seasonal cycle, with CMIP5 models generally performing better than CMIP3. Considering all North-Australia rainfall, most models reproduce the observed Australian monsoon-El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection, with the strength of the relationship dependent on the strength of the simulated ENSO. However, over the Maritime Continent, the simulated monsoon-ENSO connection is generally weaker than observed, depending on the ability of each model to realistically reproduce the ENSO signature in the Warm Pool region. A large part of this bias comes from the contribution of Papua, where moisture convergence seems to be particularly affected by this SST bias. The Indian summer monsoon-ENSO relationship is affected by overly persistent ENSO events in many CMIP models. Despite significant wind anomalies in the Indian Ocean related to Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events, the monsoon-IOD relationship remains relatively weak both in the observations and in the CMIP models. Based on model fidelity in reproducing realistic monsoon characteristics and ENSO teleconnections, we objectively select 12 ""best"" models to analyze projections in the rcp8.5 scenario. Eleven of these models are from the CMIP5 ensemble. In India and Australia, most of these models produce 5-20 % more monsoon rainfall over the second half of the twentieth century than during the late nineteenth century.

Tuna are of particular importance in the tropical Pacific, as they contribute significantly to the livelihoods, food and economic security of island states. Changes in water properties and circulation will impact on tuna larval dispersal, preferred habitat distributions and the trophic systems that support tuna populations throughout the region. Using recent observations and ocean projections from the CMIP3 and preliminary results from CMIP5 climate models, we document the projected changes to ocean temperature, salinity, stratification and circulation most relevant to distributions of tuna. Under a business-as-usual emission scenario, projections indicate a surface intensified warming in the upper 400 m and a large expansion of the western Pacific Warm Pool, with most surface waters of the central and western equatorial Pacific reaching temperatures warmer than 29 °C by 2100. These changes are likely to alter the preferred habitat of tuna, based on present-day thermal tolerances, and in turn the distribution of spawning and foraging grounds. Large-scale shoaling of the mixed layer and increases in stratification are expected to impact nutrient provision to the biologically active layer, with flow-on trophic effects on the micronekton. Several oceanic currents are projected to change, including a strengthened upper equatorial undercurrent, which could modify the supply of bioavailable iron to the eastern Pacific. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877633602

Such changes, referred to as model ""drift,"" may distort the estimate of forced change in transient climate simulations. The importance of drift is examined in comparison to historical trends over recent decades in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Comparison based on a selection of metrics suggests a significant overall reduction in the magnitude of drift from phase 3 of CMIP (CMIP3) to phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5). The direction of both ocean and atmospheric drift is systematically biased in some models introducing statistically significant drift in globally averaged metrics. Nevertheless, for most models globally averaged drift remains weak compared to the associated forced trends and is often smaller than the difference between trends derived from different ensemble members or the error introduced by the aliasing of natural variability. An exception to this is metrics that include the deep ocean (e.g., steric sea level) where drift can dominate in forced simulations. In such circumstances drift must be corrected for using information from concurrent control experiments. Many CMIP5 models now include ocean biogeochemistry. Like physical models, biogeochemical models generally undergo long spinup integrations to minimize drift. Nevertheless, based on a limited subset of models, it is found that drift is an important consideration and must be accounted for. For properties or regions where drift is important, the drift correction method must be carefully considered. The use of a drift estimate based on the full control time series is recommended to minimize the contamination of the drift estimate by internal variability. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886303975

With a half-life of 30.1 years, Cs-137 has the potential to travel large distances within the ocean. Using an ensemble of regional eddy-resolving simulations, this study investigates the long-term ventilation pathways of the leaked Cs-137 in the North Pacific Ocean. The simulations suggest that the contaminated plume would have been rapidly diluted below 10,000Bq/m3 by the energetic Kuroshio Current and Kurushio Extension by July 2011. Based on our source function of 22 Bq/m3, which sits at the upper range of the published estimates, waters with Cs-137 concentrations &gt;10Bq/m3 are projected to reach the northwestern American coast and the Hawaiian archipelago by early 2014. Driven by quasi-zonal oceanic jets, shelf waters north of 45°N experience Cs-137 levels of 10-30Bq/m3 between 2014 and 2020, while the Californian coast is projected to see lower concentrations (10-20Bq/m3) slightly later (2016-2025). This late but prolonged exposure is related to subsurface pathways of mode waters, where Cs-137 is subducted toward the subtropics before being upwelled from deeper sources along the southern Californian coast. The model suggests that Fukushima-derived Cs-137 will penetrate the interior ocean and spread to other oceanic basins over the next two decades and beyond. The sensitivity of our results to uncertainties in the source function and to inter-annual to multi-decadal variability is discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882591366

However, discrepancies exist among these products. This study uses observed Archiving, Validation, and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic (AVISO) sea surface height anomalies (SSHAs) as a means to help constrain the fidelity of these products in the tropical region. Each wind stress product is used to force a linear shallow water model (SWM) and the resulting hindcast thermocline depth anomalies are converted to SSHAs. The resulting SSHAs are then assessed to see how well they reproduce the dominant EOF modes of observed variability and the regional (global mean removed) sea level trend (1993-2007) in each of the three ocean basins. While the results suggest that all wind datasets reproduce the observed interannual variability with reasonable fidelity, the two SWM hindcasts that produce the observed linear trend with the highest fidelity are those incorporating interimECMWFRe-Analysis (ERA-Interim) and Wave- and Anemometer-Based Sea Surface Wind (WASWind) forcing. The role of surface wind forcing(i.e., upper ocean heat content redistribution) versus global mean sea level change (i.e., including the additional contributions of glacier and ice sheet melt along with ocean thermal expansion) on the recent dramaticincrease in western equatorial Pacific island sea level is then reassessed. The results suggest that the recent sea level increase cannot be explained solely by wind stress forcing, regardless of the dataset used; rather, the global mean sea level signal is required to fully explain this observed recent abrupt sea level rise and to better explain the sea level variability of the last 50-60 years. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863903496

Based on this three-dimensional representation we can accurately measure the amount of water mass remaining in an Agulhas Ring over time and consequently how much heat or salt is released from the structure as it decays.

This so-called climate drift arises for various reasons including the following: perturbations to the climate system on coupling component models together and deficiencies in model physics and numerics. When examining trends in historical or future climate simulations, it is important to know the error introduced by drift so that action can be taken where necessary. This study assesses the importance of drift for a number of climate properties at global and local scales. To illustrate this, the present paper focuses on simulated trends over the second half of the twentieth century. While drift in globally averaged surface prop- erties is generally considerably smaller than observed and simulated twentieth-century trends, it can still in- troduce nontrivial errors in some models. Furthermore, errors become increasingly important at smaller scales. The direction of drift is not systematic across different models or variables, as such drift is considerably reduced in the multimodel mean. Despite drift being primarily associated with ocean adjustment, it is also apparent in atmospheric variables. For example, most models have local drift magnitudes in surface air and ocean tem- peratures that are typically between 15% and 35% of the twentieth-century simulation trend magnitudes for 1950-2000. Below depths of 1000-2000 m, drift dominates over any forced trend in most regions. As such steric sea level is strongly affected and for some models and regions the sea level trend direction is reversed. Thus depending on the application, drift may be negligible or may make up an important part of the simulated trend. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865200158

Most models also project a reduction in the strength of the equatorial Trade winds. Typically, on ENSO time scales, a weakening of the equatorial easterlies would lead to a reduction in EUC strength in the central Pacific. The strengthening of the EUC projected for longer timescales, can be explained by a robust projected intensification of the south-easterly trade winds and an associated off-equatorial wind-stress curl change in the Southern Hemisphere. This drives the intensification of the NGCU and greater water input to the EUC in the west. A 1-layer shallow water model, driven by projected wind stress trends from the CMIP3 models demonstrates that the projected circulation changes are consistent with a purely wind driven response. While the equatorial winds weaken for both El Nio events and in the projections, the ocean response and the mechanisms driving the projected wind changes are distinct from those operating on interannual timescales. © 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861135673

However, there is a considerable range among the climate models in their projected changes of Southern Ocean wind stress. Furthermore, the strengthening of largescale southward transport tends to be compensated by eddy-induced northward flows in the abyss, particularly at eddy-permitting resolution.

The CMIP3 model evaluation undertaken by the Pacific Climate Change Science Program (PCCSP) is presented here. This includes a quantitative assessment of the ability of the models to simulate 3 climate variables: (1) surface air temperature, (2) precipitation and (3) surface wind); 3 climate features: (4) the South Pacific Convergence Zone, (5) the Intertropical Convergence Zone and (6) the West Pacific Monsoon; as well as (7) the El Niño Southern Oscillation, (8) spurious model drift and (9) the long term warming signal. For each of 1 to 9, it is difficult to identify a clearly superior subset of models, but it is generally possible to isolate particularly poor performing models. Based on this analysis, we recommend that the following models be eliminated from the multi-model ensemble, for the purposes of calculating PCCSP climate projections: INM-CM3.0, PCM and GISS-EH (consistently poor performance on 1 to 9); INGV-SXG (strong model drift); GISS-AOM and GISS-ER (poor ENSO simulation, which was considered a critical aspect of the tropical Pacific climate). Since there are relatively few studies in the peer reviewed literature that have attempted to combine metrics of model performance pertaining to such a wide variety of climate processes and phenomena, we propose that the approach of the PCCSP could be adapted to any region and set of climate model simulations. © Inter-Research 2011.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-81355164124

During El Niño episodes, the tropical Indian Ocean exhibits two types of SST response: a uniform ""basinwide warming"" and a dipole mode-the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD). While the impacts of the IOD on climate have been extensively studied, the effects of the basinwide warming, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, have received less attention. The interannual basinwide warming response has important implications for Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation because 1) it accounts for a greater portion of the Indian Ocean monthly SST variance than the IOD pattern and 2) its maximum amplitude occurs during austral summer to early autumn, when large parts of Australia, South America, and Africa experience their monsoon. Using observations and numerical experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model forced with historical SST from 1949 to 2005 over different tropical domains, the authors show that the basinwide warming leads to a Gill-Matsuno-type response that reinforces the anomalies caused by changes in the Pacific as part of El Niño. In particular, the basinwide warming drives strong subsidence over Australia, prolonging the dry conditions during January-March, when El Niño-related SST starts to decay. In addition to the anomalous circulation in the tropics, the basinwide warming excites a pair of barotropic anomalies in the Indian Ocean extratropics that induces an anomalous anticyclone in the Great Australian Bight. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960688149

For the period 1900-2006, observations, reanalysis products, and hindcasts of soil moisture during the cool season (June-October) are used to assess the impacts of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) on southeastern Australia and the Murray-Darling Basin, two regions that have recently suffered severe droughts. A distinct asymmetry is found in the impacts of the opposite phases of both ENSO and IOD on Australian rainfall and soil moisture. There are significant differences between the dominant drivers of drought at interannual and decadal time scales. On interannual time scales, both ENSO and the IOD modify southeastern Australian soil moisture, with the driest (wettest) conditions over the southeast and more broadly over large parts of Australia occurring during years when an El Niño and a positive IOD event (La Niña and a negative IOD event) co-occur. The atmospheric circulation associated with these responses is discussed. Lower-frequency variability over southeastern Australia, however, including multiyear drought periods, seems to be more robustly related to Indian Ocean temperatures than Pacific conditions. The frequencies of both positive and negative IOD events are significantly different during periods of prolonged drought compared to extended periods of ""normal"" rainfall. In contrast, the frequency of ENSO events remains largely unchanged during prolonged dry and wet periods. For the Murray-Darling Basin, there appears to be a significant influence by La Niña and both positive and negative IOD events. In particular, La Niña plays a much more prominent role than for more southern regions, especially on interannual time scales and during prolonged wet periods. For prolonged dry (wet) periods, positive IOD events also occur in unusually high (low) numbers. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955016669

Using an extended classification for ENSO and Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) events for the past 130 years and reanalyses, we have expanded previous interannual work to show that variations in Indian Ocean conditions modulate the ENSO-Indian monsoon relationship also on decadal timescales. El Nĩo events are frequently accompanied by a significantly reduced Indian monsoon and widespread drought conditions due to anomalous subsidence associated with a shift in the descending branch of the zonal Walker circulation. However, for El Nĩo events that co-occur with positive IOD (pIOD) events, Indian Ocean conditions act to counter El Nĩo's drought-inducing subsidence by enhancing moisture convergence over the Indian subcontinent, with an average monsoon season resulting.

Observational data, for which a seasonal budget can be computed, and a climate model output, which provides improved spatial and temporal coverage for longer time scales, are examined. The seasonal climatology of the model heat budget is broadly consistent with the observational reconstruction, thus providing certain confidence in extending the model analysis to interannual time scales. To identify the dominant heat budget components, covariance analysis is applied based on the heat budget equation. In addition, the role of the heat budget terms on the generation and decay of temperature anomalies is revealed via a novel temperature variance budget approach. The seasonal evolution of the mixed layer temperature is found to be largely controlled by air-sea heat fluxes, except in the tropics where advection and entrainment are important. A distinct shift in the importance and role of certain heat budget components is shown to be apparent in moving from seasonal to interannual time scales. On these longer time scales, advection gains importance in generating and sustaining anomalies over extensive regions, including the trade wind and midlatitude wind regimes. On the other hand, air-sea heat fluxes tend to drive the evolution of thermal anomalies over subtropical regions including off northwestern Australia. In the tropics, however, they limit the growth of anomalies. Entrainment plays a role in the generation and maintenance of interannual anomalies over localized regions, particularly off Sumatra and over the Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge. It is further shown that the spatial distribution of the role and importance of these terms is related to oceanographic features of the Indian Ocean.

In such events, northwestern Australia tends to be wetter in January and February when the SST warming is displaced to the central west Pacific, the opposite response to that associated with a traditional El Niño. In addition, during the bounding months, that is, December and March, there is below-average rainfall induced by an anomalous Walker circulation. This behavior tends to narrow and intensify the annual rainfall cycle over northwestern Australia relative to the climatology, causing a delayed monsoonal onset and an earlier retreat over the region. Observational datasets and numerical experiments with a general circulation model are used to examine the atmospheric response to the central west Pacific SST warming. It is shown here that the increase of precipitation, particularly in February, is phased locked to the seasonal cycle when the intertropical convergence zone is displaced southward and the South Pacific convergence zone is strengthened. An interaction between the interannual SST variability associated with El Niño Modoki events and the evolution of the seasonal cycle intensifies deep convection in the central west Pacific, driving a Gill-Matsuno-type response to the diabatic heating. The westward-propagating disturbance associated with the Gill-Matsuno mechanism generates an anomalous cyclonic circulation over northwestern Australia, leading to convergence of moisture and increased precipitation. The Gill-Matsuno-type response overwhelms the subsidence of the anomalous Walker circulation associated with Modoki events over Australia during the peak of the monsoon. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958098696

This is manifest in a distinct shift in ENSO behavior during the late 1970s. This study investigates mechanisms that may force this interdecadal variability and, in particular, on modulations driven by extratropical Rossby waves. Results from oceanic shallow-water models show that the Rossby wave theory can explain small near-zonal changes in equatorial thermocline depth that can alter the amplitude of simulated ENSO events. However, questions remain over whether the same mechanism operates in more complex coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) and what the magnitude of the resulting change would be. Experiments carried out in a state-of-the-art z-coordinate primitive equation model confirm that the Rossby wave mechanism does indeed operate. The effects of these interactions are further investigated using a partial coupling (PC) technique. This allows for the isolation of the role of wind stress-forced oceanic exchanges between the extratropics and the tropics and the subsequent modulation of ENSO variability. It is found that changes in the background state of the equatorial Pacific thermocline depth, induced by a fixed offequatorial wind stress anomaly, can significantly affect the probability of ENSO events occurring. This confirms the results obtained from simpler models and further validates theories that rely on oceanic wave dynamics to generate Pacific Ocean interdecadal variability. This indicates that an improved predictive capability for seasonal-to-interannual ENSO variability could be achieved through a better understanding of extratropical-to-tropical Pacific Ocean transfers and western boundary processes. Furthermore, such an understanding would provide a physical basis to enhance multiyear probabilistic predictions of ENSO indices. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649281648

Atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments are conducted in which the sign and magnitude of eastern Indian Ocean SST gradients are perturbed. This results in significant rainfall changes for western and southeastern Australia. A reduction (increase) in the meridional SST gradient drives a corresponding response in the atmospheric thickness gradients and results in anomalous dry (wet) conditions over Australia. During simulated wet years, this seems to be due to westerly anomalies in the thermal wind over Australia and anomalous onshore moisture advection, with a suggestion that the opposite occurs during dry conditions. Thus, an asymmetry is seen in the magnitude of the forced circulation and precipitation response between the dry and wet simulations. To assess the relative contribution of the SST anomalies making up the meridional gradient, the SST pattern is decomposed into its constituent ""poles,"" that is, the eastern tropical pole off the northwest shelf of Australia versus the southern pole in the central subtropical Indian Ocean. Overall, the simulated Australian rainfall response is linear with regard to the sign and magnitude of the eastern Indian Ocean SST gradient. The tropical eastern pole has a larger impact on the atmospheric circulation and Australian precipitation changes relative to the southern subtropical pole. However, there is clear evidence of the importance of the southern pole in enhancing the Australian rainfall response, when occurring in conjunction with but of opposite sign to the eastern tropical pole. The observed relationship between the meridional SST gradient in the eastern Indian Ocean and rainfall over western and southeastern Australia is also analyzed for the period 1970-2005.

While individual models span different physical parameterizations and resolutions, a major component of intermodel variability results from surface wind differences. Projected changes to the surface wind field are also central in modifying future extratropical circulation and internal properties. A robust southward shift of the circumpolar current and subtropical gyres is projected, with a strong spinup of the Atlantic gyre. An associated increase in the core strength of the circumpolar circulation is evident; however, this does not translate into robust increases in Drake Passage transport. While an overarching oceanic warming is projected, the circulation-driven poleward shift of the temperature field explains much of the midlatitude warming pattern. The effect of this shift is less clear for salinity, where, instead, surface freshwater forcing dominates. Surface warming and high-latitude freshwater increases drive intensified stratification, and a shoaling and southward shift of the deep mixed layers. Despite large inter-model differences, there is also a robust weakening in bottom water formation and its northward outflow. At the same time the wind intensification invigorates the upwelling of deep water, transporting warm, salty water southward and upward, with major implications for sequestration and outgassing of CO2. A robust decrease is projected for both the sea ice concentration and the seasonal cycling of ice volume, potentially altering the salt and heat budget at high latitudes. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650527129

The contributions from changes in Southern Hemisphere climate modes, particularly the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the southern annular mode (SAM), are quantified for the austral summer season, December-February (DJF). Increasingly drier conditions over much of New Zealand can be partially explained by the SAM and ENSO. Especially over wide parts of the North Island and western regions of the South Island, the SAM potentially contributes up to 80% and 20%-50% to the overall decline in DJF precipitation, respectively. Over the North Island, the contribution of the SAM and ENSO to precipitation trends is of the same sign. In contrast, over the southwest of the South Island the two climate modes act in the opposite sense, though the effect of the SAM seems to dominate there during austral summer. The leading modes of variability in summertime precipitation over New Zealand are linked to the large-scale atmospheric circulation.

During periods of enhanced East African rainfall, Indian Ocean SST anomalies reminiscent of a tropical Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) event are observed. Ensemble simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model are used to understand the relative effect of local and large-scale Indian Ocean SST anomalies on above-average East African precipitation. The importance of the various tropical and subtropical IOD SST poles, both individually and in combination, is quantified. In the simulations, enhanced East African ""short rains"" are predominantly driven by the local warm SST anomalies in the western equatorial Indian Ocean, while the eastern cold pole of the tropical IOD is of lesser importance. The changed East African rainfall distribution can be explained by a reorganization of the atmospheric circulation induced by the SST anomalies. A reduction in sea level pressure over the western half of the Indian Ocean and converging wind anomalies over East Africa lead to moisture convergence and increased convective activity over the region. The pattern of large-scale circulation changes over the tropical Indian Ocean and adjacent landmasses is consistent with an anomalous strengthening of the Walker cell. The seasonal cycle of various indices related to the SST and the atmospheric circulation in the equatorial Indian Ocean are examined to assess their potential usefulness for seasonal forecasting. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-64049101038

Two sets of AGCM integrations forced with a seasonally evolving characteristic dipole pattern in Indian Ocean SST consistent with observed ""dry year"" (PDRY) and ""wet year"" (PWET) signatures are shown to induce precipitation changes across western regions of Australia. Over Western Australia, a significant shift occurs in the winter and annual rainfall frequency with the distribution becoming skewed toward less (more) rainfall for the PDRY (PWET) SST pattern. For southwest Western Australia (SWWA), this shift primarily is due to the large-scale stable precipitation. Convective precipitation actually increases in the PDRY case over SWWA forced by local positive SST anomalies. A mechanism for the large-scale rainfall shifts is proposed, by which the SST anomalies induce a reorganization of the large-scale atmospheric circulation across the Indian Ocean basin. Thickness (1000-500 hPa) anomalies develop in the atmosphere mirroring the sign and position of the underlying SST anomalies. This leads to a weakening (strengthening) of the meridional thickness gradient and the subtropical jet during the austral winter in PDRY (PWET). The subsequent easterly offshore (westerly onshore) anomaly in the thermal wind over southern regions of Australia, along with a decrease (increase) in baroclinicity, results in the lower (higher) levels of large-scale stable precipitation. Variations in the vertical thermal structure of the atmosphere overlying the SST anomalies favor localized increased convective activity in PDRY because of differential temperature lapse rates. In contrast, enhanced widespread ascent of moist air masses associated with frontal movement in PWET accounts for a significant increase in rainfall in that ensemble set. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349123164

The use of such an offline methodology represents the only feasible way of simulating the long time scales required to validate the internal pathways of a high-resolution ocean model. Simulated and observed chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11) are in reasonably good agreement, demonstrating the model's skill in representing realistic ventilation. Regional passive dye and age tracer experiments aid in the identification of pathways originating from different Southern Hemisphere locations. Northern Hemisphere penetration of intermediate, mode, and thermocline waters is most extensive and rapid into the North Atlantic Ocean because these waters are involved in closing the Atlantic meridional overturning cell. However, less than 8% of this ventilation is derived from subduction within the South Atlantic in the simulation. Instead, this water enters the Atlantic just to the south of South Africa, having originally subducted primarily in the east Indian Ocean, but also in the west Indian Ocean and the west Pacific region where a pathway advects water westward to the south of Australia. This pathway also plays a large part, together with water overturned in the east Indian Ocean, in ventilating the northern reaches of the Indian basin. Northward propagation in the Pacific Ocean is limited to the low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and is almost exclusively accomplished by water subducted in the South Pacific. A small contribution is made from the other basins from water that spreads northward, fed by a circumpolar pathway associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that forms a conduit for intermediate and mode water exchange between all three basins. Intermediate water is injected into and branches off this pathway in all basins, but most vigorously in the southeastern Pacific. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549118918

This study investigates the extent of ""back interaction"" whereby these oceanic SAM anomalies feed back to the atmosphere. A comparison between atmosphere-only and full coupled climate models demonstrates that air-sea interactions in the coupled system act to increase the persistence of the SAM in the atmosphere. To identify the nature of feedback from the ocean to the atmosphere, ensemble experiments are carried out in both atmosphere-only and full coupled models whereby a continuous SAM-like sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly is imposed. Both coupled and uncoupled experiments show a direct thermal response that affects the lower-tropospheric temperature and surface meridional winds. An indirect upper troposphere-wide response is also seen whose characteristics are sensitive to the coupling. For the uncoupled experiment a negative-phase SAM SST perturbation produces an indirect atmospheric response that projects strongly onto the SAM. A positive-phase anomaly, however, shows little robust response away from the local heating at the surface. The coupled experiments, however, do show linearity with respect to the sign of the anomaly. However, the response is considerably weaker than the uncoupled case and the projection of the response onto the SAM mode is poorer. Nonetheless the authors find a clear persistence of the SAM at interseasonal time scales that relies on air-sea coupling and cannot be reproduced in unforced atmosphere-only experiments. This demonstrates that the ocean plays a role in modulating the Southern Annular Mode at these time scales. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547895963

The model shows considerable skill in capturing the predominantly zonally symmetric SAM while regional deviations between model and observation SAM winds go a long way in explaining the generally small differences between simulated and observed SAM responses in the ocean and sea ice systems. Vacillations in the position and strength of the circumpolar winds and the ensuing variations in advection of heat and moisture result in a dynamic and thermodynamic forcing of the ocean and sea ice. Both meridional and zonal components of ocean circulation are modified through Ekman transport, which in turn leads to anomalous surface convergences and divergences that strongly affect the meridional over-turning circulation and potentially the pathways of intermediate water ventilation. A heat budget analysis demonstrates a conspiring of oceanic meridional heat advection, surface heat fluxes, and changes in mixed layer depth, which acts in phase to imprint a strong circumpolar SAM signature onto sea surface temperatures (SSTs), while other oceanic processes, including vertical advection, are shown to play only a minor role in contrast to previous suggestions. Lagged correlations show that although the SAM is mainly controlled by internal atmospheric mechanisms, the thermal inertia of the ocean reimprints the SAM signature back onto surface air temperatures (SATs) on time scales longer than the initial atmospheric signal. Sea ice variability is well explained by a combination of atmospheric and oceanic dynamic and thermodynamic forcing, and by an albedo feedback mechanism that allows ice extent anomalies to persist for many months. Nonzonally symmetric components of the SAM winds, particularly in the region surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula, have important effects for other climate variables. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749584631

Yet exotic species introductions remain difficult to predict and are easily misunderstood because knowledge of natural dispersal patterns, species diversity, and biogeography is often insufficient to distinguish between a broadly dispersed natural population and an exotic one. Here we compare a global molecular phylogeny of a representative marine meroplanktonic taxon, the moon-jellyfish Aurelia, with natural dispersion patterns predicted by a global biophysical ocean model. Despite assumed high dispersal ability, the phylogeny reveals many cryptic species and predominantly regional structure with one notable exception: the globally distributed Aurelia sp.1, which, molecular data suggest, may occasionally traverse the Pacific unaided. This possibility is refuted by the ocean model, which shows much more limited dispersion and patterns of distribution broadly consistent with modern biogeographic zones, thus identifying multiple introductions worldwide of this cryptogenic species. This approach also supports existing evidence that (i) the occurrence in Hawaii of Aurelia sp. 4 and other native Indo-West Pacific species with similar life histories is most likely due to anthropogenic translocation, and (ii) there may be a route for rare natural colonization of northeast North America by the European marine snail Littorina littorea, whose status as endemic or exotic is unclear. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-24744440336

In doing so, the authors are able to meaningfully simulate chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) uptake and assess model skill against observation. This is the first time an eddy-permitting model has been subjected to such an assessment of interior ocean ventilation. The offline model is forced by seasonally varying prescribed velocity, temperature, and salinity fields of a state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model. A seasonally varying mixed layer parameterization is incorporated to account for the degradation of surface convection processes resulting from the temporal averaging. A series of CFC simulations are assessed against observations to investigate interdecadal-time-scale ventilation using a variety of mixed layer criteria. Simulated tracer inventories and penetration depths are in good agreement with observations, especially for thermocline, mode, and surface waters. Deep water from the Labrador Sea is well represented, forming a distinct deep western boundary current that branches at the equator, although concentrations are lower than observed. The formation of bottom water, which occurs around the Antarctic margin, is also generally too weak, although there is excellent qualitative agreement with observations in the region of the Ross and Weddell Seas. Multicentury ventilation of the outflow of North Atlantic Deep Water and bottom water from the Antarctic Margin are investigated using 1000-yr passive tracer experiments with specified interior source regions. The model captures many of the detailed pathways evident from observations, with much of the discrepancy accounted for by differences between actual and modeled topography.
